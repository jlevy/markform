# Feature Validation: Code Coverage CI Implementation

## Purpose

Validation spec for the code coverage infrastructure implementation, confirming that
coverage reporting, PR comments, badges, and threshold enforcement work correctly.

**Feature Plan:** [plan-2025-12-31-code-coverage-implementation.md](plan-2025-12-31-code-coverage-implementation.md)

## Validation Planning

This feature primarily requires CI-based validation since coverage reports and PR comments
are generated by GitHub Actions. Local testing validates configuration and threshold
enforcement.

## Automated Validation (Testing Performed)

### Unit Testing

No new unit tests added - this is CI infrastructure only.

Existing tests validate:

- All 792 tests pass with coverage enabled
- Coverage thresholds are met (50/49/50/50)
- `pnpm precommit` passes successfully

### Integration and End-to-End Testing

**Local Coverage Validation (Completed):**

```bash
# Verified locally:
pnpm --filter markform test:coverage
# Result: All tests pass, thresholds met
# Output: coverage/coverage-summary.json generated correctly
```

**Coverage Report Files (Verified):**

| File | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `coverage/coverage-summary.json` | ✅ Generated |
| `coverage/coverage-final.json` | ✅ Generated |
| `coverage/lcov.info` | ✅ Generated |
| `coverage/index.html` | ✅ Generated |

### Manual Testing Needed

The following must be validated after the PR is created and CI runs:

#### 1. CI Coverage Run

After pushing to the PR branch, verify:

```bash
# Check CI status
gh pr checks <pr_number> -R jlevy/markform
```

Expected:

- [ ] CI job completes successfully
- [ ] `pnpm --filter markform test:coverage` step passes
- [ ] No errors in coverage generation

#### 2. PR Coverage Comment

After CI completes on a PR:

- [ ] Coverage comment appears on PR
- [ ] Comment shows coverage summary (statements, branches, functions, lines)
- [ ] Changed files section shows coverage for modified files
- [ ] Comment updates (not duplicates) on subsequent pushes

#### 3. Coverage Artifacts

- [ ] Coverage artifact uploaded to GitHub Actions
- [ ] Artifact contains HTML report and JSON files
- [ ] Artifact can be downloaded from Actions UI

#### 4. Coverage Badge (After Merge to Main)

After merging to main:

- [ ] Badge action runs on main branch push
- [ ] `./badges/coverage-total.svg` is updated in repo
- [ ] Badge shows in README with correct percentage

#### 5. Threshold Enforcement

To verify thresholds work:

```bash
# Temporarily lower threshold to trigger failure
# Edit vitest.config.ts: statements: 99
pnpm --filter markform test:coverage
# Expected: Build fails with threshold error
```

## CI Workflow Validation Checklist

```yaml
# Verify these steps exist in .github/workflows/ci.yml:
- [ ] test:coverage runs instead of test
- [ ] vitest-coverage-report-action@v2 configured for PRs
- [ ] coverage-badges-action@v1.4.6 configured for main
- [ ] upload-artifact@v4 uploads coverage folder
```

## Files Changed

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/markform/vitest.config.ts` | Added json-summary, reportOnFailure, lowered thresholds |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Added coverage steps, badge action, artifact upload |
| `README.md` | Added CI and coverage badges |
| `docs/development.md` | Added code coverage documentation section |
| `badges/coverage-total.svg` | Initial placeholder badge |

## Open Questions

None - implementation is complete pending CI validation.
