# Contributing to Markform

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Markform! This document explains how to
contribute and the legal requirements for doing so.

## How to Contribute

1. **Open an issue** to discuss your proposed change before starting work
2. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
3. **Make your changes** with clear commit messages
4. **Run tests** with `npm test` and ensure they pass
5. **Submit a pull request** with a description of your changes

See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for development setup instructions.

## Contributor License Agreement

This project uses a **dual licensing model**: the code is available under AGPL-3.0 for
open source use, with commercial licenses available for organizations that prefer
different terms.

To enable this dual licensing while keeping contribution simple, we use a
Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) combined with a licensing grant.

### What You're Agreeing To

By submitting a pull request or patch to this repository, you agree to the following:

1. **You have the right to submit the contribution.** Your contribution is your original
   work, or you have the necessary rights to submit it under this agreement.

2. **You license your contribution under AGPL-3.0-or-later.** Your contribution will be
   distributed under the same AGPL-3.0-or-later license as the rest of the project.

3. **You grant additional licensing rights.** You grant the project maintainer (Joshua
   Levy) the right to relicense your contribution under alternative license terms,
   including commercial licenses. This enables the dual-licensing model that supports
   the project's sustainability.

4. **You understand contributions to specification documents are CC-BY-4.0.** The
   Markform Specification (`docs/markform-spec.md` and `docs/markform-reference.md`)
   are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International. Contributions
   to these documents are licensed under CC-BY-4.0.

### How to Sign Off

Include a "Signed-off-by" line in your commit messages:

```

The sign-off certifies that you agree to the terms above. This is based on the
[Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/).
