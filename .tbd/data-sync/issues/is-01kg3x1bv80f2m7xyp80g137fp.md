Umbrella epic for incorporating valuable improvements identified in Grok's table-field PR (#31) into our implementation.

## Context
During review of competing PR #31 (Grok's table-field implementation), several improvements were identified that should be incorporated into our PR #30.

## Items to Incorporate
1. **SPEC.md Documentation Updates** - Comprehensive table-field documentation
2. **columnCount/columnsById in StructureSummary** - Better form structure analysis
3. **QualifiedColumnRef Type** - Typed template literal for column references
4. **More Detailed Validation Spec** - Better test case documentation
