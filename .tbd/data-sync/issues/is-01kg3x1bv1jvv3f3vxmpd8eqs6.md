After the initial user fill is complete, proceed to agent fill step: 1) Pick a -filled2.form.md default name using standard naming library 2) Run agent in live mode on the previous file (typically -filled1.form.md) 3) Write outputs in multiple formats: .form.md (the filled form), .raw.md (export as raw markdown), .yml (values as YAML)
