Add new table-field type to Markform for structured tabular data with typed columns. See docs/project/specs/active/plan-2025-12-27-table-field-type.md. Not yet started - implementation covers 9 phases from type definitions through documentation.

## Notes

Implementation complete: TableField types in coreTypes.ts, table/parseTable.ts, examples in simple.form.md. All 640 tests pass.
