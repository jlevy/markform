Review that simple.form.md example form includes:

- All field types (string, number, string_list, single_select, multi_select, checkboxes)
- All checkbox modes (multi, simple, explicit)
- Required and optional fields
- Validation attributes (pattern, minLength, maxLength, min/max for numbers)
- Custom validators
- Documentation blocks (description, instructions)
- Field groups

Ensure tests cover all features and pass.
